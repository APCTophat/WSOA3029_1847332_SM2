            For now, I am keeping the wireframe I am keeping the wireframe simple. The header will occupy the top 1/5<sup>th</sup> or 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the page. The rest will be page content that can expand downwards to compensate for the content on the page. There is some extra space at the bottom I could use as a footer or move the header down to be a footer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This wireframe should be compatible for mobile and it focuses on the vertical nature of mobile phones. The padding around each interactable section of the wireframe should mean that no page content is left right at the edge of screen. Where it is either hard to see or hard to click on. 
        </p>

            For this website I was tasked to work with the visualization of data. To create a website that says something, not with the words on it, but with a graphic. As of writing this I do not have much to show on my website. I have kept it super simple due to the rushed nature I am doing this in. More on this topic in my week 1 blog.

            Colours: Let me start with something fun. A trend I have noticed is a shift in ‘dark mode’ websites, so for my website I wanted to keep the colours darker. I went with the deep purple “#41394d” for the background and for the header background I went with a lighter “#6f6282”. Then for the normal text I used the “whitesmoke” as I don’t find it as harsh on the eyes as plain white, but it still contrasts with the purple. Finally, any highlighted words (button text or in-text words) I used the orange “#ffc94a” to create contrast. These colours still stand out even when rendering the page with the different visual deficiencies.
