            <span class="GridItems">Hello there, I am the About Page. I am here because the guy making this website has neglected this part of his website for too long. So he asked me if I could get you up to speed with what is going on.</span>

    <p>
        Since this website is all about data visualisation, I decided I would make my own. So, I have been monitoring the website creator and taking down how long he is spending on each different section of the website. Then I made a bar graph showing each different section in relation to one another. Why donâ€™t I show accurate hour values you ask? Well I believe if the website creator knew how long he has spent making the website he would have a heart attack. But I can reassure you viewer it is a loooooong time, probably around 180 hours.
    </p>

    <div class="GraphHolder">
        <img class="GraphImage" src="../WebsiteReasources/About Page Graph.png" alt="The graph showing how much relative time I have worked on each section of the website">
        </div>  

        <p>
            Look at the state of this graph! He has clearly spent way too much time on his creative work and do not tell him I said this, but I heard he still must do more. But I am sure what he has is fantastic. The blog posts are next and frankly that makes sense, it is a lot of reading and writing he has had to do to make well informed and thought out blogs. Then it is the homepage, obviously, have you seen those navigation buttons? I love them so much. Second to last comes the design, I believe he could have put a bit more effort in becauseâ€¦ purple and yellow?! I still donâ€™t know if it works or it is just because I have just been here for too long. Then we get to me! All the way at the bottom, sad really. But that is why I am here ðŸ˜Š.
        </p>

        <p>
            His brief is to make a website focused on data-visualisation, sort of the thing I have done above but far more accurate. With the focus centred around Covid-19, making graphs using open source data found online about it. This is good choice as there is plenty of on going data surrounding the pandemic and data visualisation is an important aspect to the global sharing of information. On this lovely oddly coloured website you can find:
        </p>
<li>A <i>Homepage</i> that functions as a landing page for the website.</li>
<li>An <i>About section</i> that discusses what is on the website and why it is there.</li>
<li>A <i>Blog section</i> that showcases my theoretical engagement with topics related to data visualisation.</li>
<li>A <i>Creative work</i> section that showcases his attempts at data visualisation.</li>
<li>A <i>Design</i> section that shows what choices he made for the websites format.</li>

<p>
    The <i>homepage</i> is the first thing a viewer like yourself saw. His intention was to make introduce you to all the possible areas of the website through navigation whilst showing you the importance of circles. That is why, whilst there is still a navigation bar you could still navigate using those interactable circles.
</p>
<p>
Next is the <i>about section</i>. Without getting too meta about it, it is the section that explains what is going on in the website. So why I am, the About Page, telling you this and not the website creator. Well he thinks he is being funny and cheeky but maybe it is just annoying at the end of the day.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Blog sections</i> contains an archive of all the blogs that you the viewer have access to. Once again, the first thing you hopefully notice is the continuation of circles in the design. Then the blogs are mainly made up of text and images that showcase what he was thinking or feeling about a certain topic at the time. His blogs could have more academic engagement but due to time and other responsibilities he was unable to engage with these topics in a more academic manor.
</p>

<p>
    Ah the <i>Creative work</i> section, the meat and potatoes of the website if you will, this is where all the graphs are. Like the blog section you are introduced to an archive of the blogs and the circular motif. However, there is an added gravy to this dish. That is central inspiration of a poem he found. He has based his graphs on different aspects of this poem and attempts to explain them before showcases his graphs. He has generally made his graphs using an open source Covid-19 API, SVGâ€™s for drawing the graph and D3 for manipulating the graphs.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, there is the <i>Design</i> aspect of the website. This part is dedicated to explaining (why in the world he chose PURPLE and YELLOW) the choices he made when constructing the website. Choices such as the wireframe and the colour used throughout the website. Honestly this section could go more in depth, but I believe it is serviceable for now. Maybe I need to visit that page too.
</p>
<p>  
So that is what this website is <i>about</i>. I hope you enjoy and maybe its creator has done something to inspire you like he has inspired himself.
