            For this website I was tasked to work with the visualization of data. To create a website that says something, not with the words on it, but with a graphic. As of writing this I do not have much to show on my website. I have kept it super simple due to the rushed nature I am doing this in. More on this topic in my week 1 blog.

            Colours: Let me start with something fun. A trend I have noticed is a shift in ‘dark mode’ websites, so for my website I wanted to keep the colours darker. I went with the deep purple “#41394d” for the background and for the header background I went with a lighter “#6f6282”. Then for the normal text I used the “whitesmoke” as I don’t find it as harsh on the eyes as plain white, but it still contrasts with the purple. Finally, any highlighted words (button text or in-text words) I used the orange “#ffc94a” to create contrast. These colours still stand out even when rendering the page with the different visual deficiencies.
