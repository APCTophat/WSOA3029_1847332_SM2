        <h2 id="BlogHeading">Exam Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I believe it would be best to reflect on my data-driven artwork by breaking it into the technical, creative, and theoretical aspects of them. As I feel these aspects are not equally explored in each artwork. I will also be breaking down all four artworks aspects at once to provide a more general view of my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will begin by talking about the technical implementation of these artworks as I believe that is the aspect, I spent the most time on. To make these interactive artworks I used a combination of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and D3. As well as using a public <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc" target="blank">Covid-19 API</a> provided by Postman to gather data about Covid-19 to draw my graphs. My main focus was to use data relevant to South Africa as its handling of the Covid-19 is most relevant to me. I used JavaScript to handle this data and D3 to apply it to my website visualisations. I also used JavaScript and D3 to create intractability with my graphs. This allows the viewer to manipulate how they view the graph to gather specific information they wish to view. I then used CSS and JavaScript to make sure the graph fit and functioned on a range of different form factors, ensuring the graphs did not distort as the screen size changed. Overall a lot of time was dedicated to learning how to manipulate SVG elements through CSS, JavaScript and D3 to create my graphs. The technical aspect is the one I focused on the most as it was the aspect that most interested me. I believe that my graphs are technically well made, generally they are not complex but have consistency in their interactivity and view in different form factors. While I spent a lot of time getting this graph technically working, I feel this left the other two aspects lacking in some regards.
        </p>

        <p>
            I did try to make my graphs thematically and creatively coherent with my use of colour and motifs. My graphs use the same yellow to black hues that I chose to contrast the purple background of my website. With the general theme of moving from the ‘bright’ yellow to the ‘dark’ black, however this motif is inverted for my final graph as its theme is also an inversion of the other graphs. Another motif I utilised is making my graphs out of ‘circles’ with the exception being my third graph as it is a bar graph, my graphs use circles in its visual language. My first three graphs take inspiration from lines of a poem and have the general theme of acknowledging the dead who did not survive the tragedy. I felt this theme was somewhat fitting for a global pandemic and so the data-points I generally used were related to total deaths, change in deaths or death rates. This theming is contrasted by my final graph which I tried to theme around the hope that you can only give yourself. With the inspiration taken not from the poem but a quote from a fictional character. With my final graph attempting to acknowledge the individuals who have Covid-19 and have to hope while knowing the fatality rate. I like the visual and thematic elements I chose to use for my graphs, they are a bit strange and macabre, but I feel they have their own charm to them. While they are not completely consistent throughout, I feel I have done an adequate job at conveying a consistent theme across these works.
        </p>

            The theoretical integration in my work is the aspect that is most lacking. I believe this is because my theoretical engagement is lacking throughout my website. With the focus being the creative and technical elements that have gone into making the website. Overall, I have tried to consider what my graphs look like and what they are saying. For example, my first graph has this enveloping feeling that I like, which represents the overwhelming nature of seeing more and more people dying. I have also tried to make some commentary on the way data-visualisation can be used to completely overshadow certain prices of data. For example, in my third graph I have ‘Comparison’ view mode which puts both the deaths and recovery on the same scale. Which while ‘accurate’ practically says that those who died are insignificant in comparison. Which reinforces my themes that we need to acknowledge and remember those who died in this pandemic. Through my exploration of making these graphs I come to recognised and respect the power that data-visualisation has in communicating a message.
