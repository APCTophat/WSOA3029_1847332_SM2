        <p>
            While this blog says it is part of week 1, it is more accurate to say that this blog is more of a reflection blog. Written on the 5th of September looking back at the block I just had with this course and explaining why my website looks just awful.
        </p>
        <p>
            First things first. I have nothing but love and respect for my lecture’s and tutors. 2020 is just a piece of work and I cannot even keep myself afloat let alone worry about keeping a couple dozen other people afloat. So, when I bring up topics like, me missing lectures or not asking question or resources missing on sakai, I am not upset or angry. I am just tired, and it gives me a weird comfort to know that it is not just me. I also want to say I am so grateful for the technical lectures Lucky gave. They helped me a lot, and I am sorry for not asking any questions. I do not want him to think he was not appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me first cover the things out of my control. As of writing this there is no content visible to me on week 7 at all, week 6 has the week goal but none of the lecture materials. And week 4 and 5 ask me to write about readings I could not find on sakai. Again, no hard feelings to anyone responsible for these things. I am trying to get an entire semester worth of work done in a week for Peets sake.

            So why does my website just not look like a website at all? Or the better question, why did I try build a website in a week? Basically, it was a combination of deadlines from my other subjects, the mental tole lock down and the pandemic took, and the snowball effect of falling behind. I just did not work on my website for the first few weeks of the block to the intense workload of my other subjects. This just snowballed week to week until now I am here. I wish I didn’t have to have any sort of ‘excuse’ but 2020 is what 2020 is.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really wanted to do more with my website by this point. I am scared to even look at the other students’ websites as I fear knowing how far behind, it will demoralise me. I have accepted that in the current form my website, it is subpar. I do want to improve it but it will not be anywhere near where it should be for this submission.
