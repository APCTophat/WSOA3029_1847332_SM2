        <p>In chapter 1 <i>Theories of Representation</i> from <i>Representation</i> by Jenny Kidd. Kidd discusses how phenomena are represented in visual communication, how it relates to <i>Denotations</i> and <i>Connotations</i>, <i>Orientalism</i>, <i>Visual Communication</i>, <i>Infographics</i> and <i>the persuasive nature of images.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Kidd begins by discusses the relationship from what we “see” and what is “understood. Providing an example of the denotative and connotative understanding of the ‘Apple logo’. With the denotative reading of the logo being that of an apple with a bite taken out of it and the connotative reading being that of the ‘Apple brand’. With the perception being dependent on the individual’s biases towards the ‘Apple brand’. While the denotative depiction of the logo does not change from viewer to viewer, what that depictions says does change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kidd extends this train of thought to <i>Orientalism</i>, coined by Edward Said in 1978 it is the “process by which Western media outlets manufacture representations of the Middle East and East Asia.” So, whilst the ‘people’ being represented are real with their own culture and styles, how they are represented eventually becomes who ‘they are’. I put ‘they are’ in air quotes because this type of overarching representation is seen when discussing an ‘other’. With ‘they’ imminently implying an othering and ‘are’ describing the perceived understanding of these ‘other people’ that has been propagated through their representation. With enough prolific representation of a phenomena within a culture, anyone or anything prescribed to be part of that phenomena becomes that phenomena. Carrying all the connotative representation that comes with it.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Images have a connotative function with how they communicate being summarised by several factors of the image: How abstract the image is, if the communicative purpose is denotative or connotative in its context and the images use of established connotations to communicate the intended idea. An example of this is the public bathroom signs. The abstract figure on each door, whether that be male, female, disabled or baby change room, functions to express who (according to the social contract) and for what purpose these rooms are for. The abstract nature of the image, the denotative nature and the pre-established social norms all work together to provide instant communication to the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have seen the use of infographics to communicate efficiently. Typically uses abstract representations for people or phenomena. Who, What and How things are represented in these infographics is an important topic. Since the intention for infographics are to be seen and understood, the intended message being said needs to be clear. With the colours used, scale of graphs and even the structure all play a part in producing a meaning. These elements are all manipulated by the infographic creator, that is why it is important to recognise what the infographic is trying to tell you as well as what it is trying to persuade you to believe.

            The theoretical integration in my work is the aspect that is most lacking. I believe this is because my theoretical engagement is lacking throughout my website. With the focus being the creative and technical elements that have gone into making the website. Overall, I have tried to consider what my graphs look like and what they are saying. For example, my first graph has this enveloping feeling that I like, which represents the overwhelming nature of seeing more and more people dying. I have also tried to make some commentary on the way data-visualisation can be used to completely overshadow certain prices of data. For example, in my third graph I have ‘Comparison’ view mode which puts both the deaths and recovery on the same scale. Which while ‘accurate’ practically says that those who died are insignificant in comparison. Which reinforces my themes that we need to acknowledge and remember those who died in this pandemic. Through my exploration of making these graphs I come to recognised and respect the power that data-visualisation has in communicating a message.
