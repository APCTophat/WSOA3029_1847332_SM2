        <h2 id="BlogHeading">An analysis of Michael Friendly’s “A brief history of data visualization”</h2>
        <p>
            Friendly begins by dispelling the notion that data visualisation is a ‘modern’ trend. Explaining how it has its earliest ‘roots’ in map-making and visual depictions. Intertwined with fields such as medicine and science and grew with the growth a statistical analysis and data collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a comprehensive idea of the use of data visualization throughout history Friendly represents the data visually in a graph (without a hint of irony). This allows us to see how much data visualisation was used over certain ‘milestones’ of history. The graph taken from page 3 of <i>A brief history of data visualisation</i> by Michael Friendly:

As this graph clearly indicates that data visualisation has been on a general rise over the centuries but that its certainly is not a ‘young’ phenomenon. I will briefly cover each ‘milestone’ presented by Michael Friendly, describing what information was being represented and how it was represented.

        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Early maps and diagrams</h4>
            <li>The use of measuring tools to plot data on tables, tracking celestial bodies or creating cartography maps for navigation.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Measurement and theory</h4>
            <li>Mainly focused on physical measurement and practical application</li>
            <li>Saw the creation of graphical methodology and theories to interpret the visual data</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>New Graphic forms</h4>
            <li>Expansion on aspects of new domains and graphic forms</li>
            <li>Experimenting with representation, representing places on maps with images</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Beginnings of Modern graphics</h4>
            <li>Explosive growth in statistical graphics and thematic mapping.</li>
            <li>Saw the analysis of natural and physical phenomena using now standard methods of representation such as bar and pie charts</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>The Golden Age of statistical graphics</h4>
            <li>Saw an explosion in the use of 3D surface plots of population data and contour diagrams.</li>
            <li>New graphical forms were invented to extend what could be graphically represented.</li>
            <li>Visualisation as a form of collection, organization and dissemination of statistics</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>The modern dark ages</h4>
            <li>Functioned more as a time of applying and popularising established graphical methods. New methodologies were largely not explored.</li>
            <li>This period still saw statistical graphics in the social mainstream.</li>
           
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Re-Birth of data visualisation</h4>
            <li>Computer processing allowed for interactive statistical applications.</li>
            <li>New technologies provided new graphical innovations</li>
           
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>High-D, interactive and dynamic data visualization</h4>
            <li>Developments in visualization methods and techniques depended upon theoretical and technological infrastructure</li>
            <li>New technologies allowed for the creation of dynamic graphic methods. That support instantaneous data manipulation </li>
           
        </p>
        <p>
            
Data visualisation is a phenomenon that has been explored and developed over several centuries of human existence. Stemming mainly from practical needs or goals, human curiosity to understand what is happening around them has led to the creation of a phenomenon rich in history and methodologies that are utilised even today. As technologies and needs change, so does the way data is visualised. Data visualisation has become a language that has the potential to be widely understood and utilized worldwide.
