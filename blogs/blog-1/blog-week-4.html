        <h2 id="BlogHeading">Data-Driven Storytelling</h2>
        <p>Disclaimer: This blog post is going to be a little more laid back. Why? Because the year known as 2020 has done a number on everyone. I can see this as my instructions for this essay are to reflect on one of the selected essays from Riche’s <i>Data-driven storytelling</i> and no essays were provided. As I am doing my blog post on the 3rd of September, because lord knows I am so far behind, listening to “Here I go again” by  Whitesnakes, I hope I can take away what I was intended to from this reading.</p>
        <p>
            I could also be very stupid and not notice the reading resource, but I currently cannot find it anywhere on Sakai. At this point, I see little point in bugging an already stressed and overworked department for a very minor blog resource that I should have had done like a month ago. So, I found the book on Google Scholar and only have the preview to research from. From the preview <i>chapter 11: Evaluating Data-Driven Stories and Storytelling Tools</i> seems to be the most comprehensive to write about. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this chapter Riche intends to provide a review of how Data-Driven Stories (DDS) are evaluated, evaluated in different viewing contexts. Also intending to review possible criteria for assessing if the goals of DDS are met.
        </p>
        <p>
            Riche brings up the topic of <i>Spontaneous Retellings of Events</i>, explaining a study conducted where participants documented their retelling of events they told to their social community. With the focus being on the purposeful inaccuracy in their storytelling, finding that 61% of their retelling had been changed in some form. This level of inaccuracy is something that is deemed unacceptable in a formal news report. I believe why Riche is bringing this up in a section about evaluating DDS’s is for us to remember that whilst we would like to believe that ‘data’ is this objective truth with no biases or agendas; There exists a real possibility that whilst recounting the data of a phenomenon there will be inaccuracies implemented by those doing the recounting. This is something we need to look out for and try to not replicate in our own work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discourse is the conversation that happens around a phenomenon. Data cannot be talked about in a vacuum due to the nature that the data itself represents a phenomenon and is part of that phenomena’s discourse. The example given by Riche is that of columns written by Nicholas Kristof in the <i>The New York Times.</i> It included a graphic that was mainly text but showed an illness caused by contaminated water and the annual death caused by these illnesses with a short description expanding on the illness. Whilst the data point (annual death due to contaminated water) may seem like an isolated data set, it is part of the major discourse around the access to clean water around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe the main take away from this chapter is that all ‘Data’ is something that is ‘told’ in some form or another. When we ‘tell’ or ‘say’ something we create a story, not in the conventional ‘once upon a time’ types of stories, but a narrative. The data says something, it means something. It is up to the tellers to show what the data is trying to say, and it is up to the audience to decipher what the teller is trying to say. When both are working in unison a clear message can be conveyed.
