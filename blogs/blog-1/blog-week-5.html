        <h2 id="BlogHeading">Representation and Communication</h2>
        <p>
            For this blog post I will be discussing a data visualisation that can be found on the <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/" target="blank"><i>Information is Beautiful</i></a> website. I will be looking at an example in term of how it represents its subject matter as well as how it communicates to the viewer. Before I explain what the graph I chose represents I think it is important the idiom it is referencing.
        </p>
        <p>
            To “make a mountain out of a molehill” is a cliché to make a major issue out of a minor one; to exaggerate the importance of something. According to McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs. © 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. So basically, if someone stubs their toe and cries, they are going to have to amputate their leg. But who in their everyday lives would this even apply to? Oh hi news media, I didn’t see you there.
        </p>
        <p>
            All joking aside, the graphical visualisation <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/mountains-out-of-molehills/" target="blank">“Mountains Out of Molehills”</a> shows a timeline from the year 2000 to 2018 against an intensity of a phenomena’s media coverage. The graphic showcases several phenomena in contrast with one another. Using a solid colour to represent each phenomenon. Examples include “Ebola, SARS and Violent Video Games”. Below is a screenshot of the graphic: 
        </p>
        <div class="PhotoHolder">
        <img class="BlogImage" src="../../WebsiteReasources/MOoM Base.png" alt="The base graph">
        </div>
        <p>
            I want to focus on one phenomenon as an example but before I do that I will explore the graphic more. The first notable aspect of this graphic is that each phenomena doesn’t start at the same baseline. I believe this is done to allow for greater clarity and since the Y-axis doesn’t have a particular ‘value’ associated with it I believe it does not affect the overall perception of an individual phenomena. However, there is still a setting a user can press to align the graphs to the baseline. This is what the graphic looks like with this setting on:
        </p>
        <div class="PhotoHolder">
        <img class="BlogImage" src="../../WebsiteReasources/MooM YAxis.png" alt="The base graph but all the phenomena are on the same baseline">
        </div>
        <p>
            
The next setting, I want to highlight is “Scale to fir Ebola” which when I think about really highlights. The fact that this is even an option really highlights how mountainous ‘Ebola’ was in the media. I am sure if this graphic was extended to 2020, we would see a similar situation with COVID-19. But enabling this scaling really shows the viewer the scale difference between “Ebola’s” media coverage and the other phenomena.

        </p>
        <div class="PhotoHolder">
        <img class="BlogImage" src="../../WebsiteReasources/MOoM Ebola.png" alt="THe graph in relation to ebola">
        </div>
        <p>
            The final viewing option is “Scale by death”, this setting really puts into perspective the difference between what is a molehill and what is a mountain. With this setting the ‘Y-Axis’ changes to No. of Deaths but still never provides a concrete value on that axis. However, this still allows the viewer to see the difference between the phenomena. Swine Flu was far more deadly that Ebola yet the intensity of media coverage would indicate otherwise. There are also some ‘mountains’ that just disappear with this viewing setting. This isn’t to say no one has died due to these phenomena but rather the scale in comparison is negligible.
        </p>
        <div class="PhotoHolder">
        <img class="BlogImage" src="../../WebsiteReasources/MOoM Death.png" alt="The graph showing the no of deaths for each phenomena">
        </div>  
        <p>
            This bring me to the example I want to highlight. The “Violent Video Games” phenomena. What interest me about this phenomenon, besides being a Game Design student and video games being my life (No clear bias present), is that this mountain-ing seems to be omnipresent. While it certainly isn’t the only phenomena that has seen media coverage over the 18 years, it is one of the most consistent and intensive ones. In contrast examples such as the phenomena ‘Millenium bug’ did not see any news coverage after the year 2000. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When a phenomenon is highlighted on the graphic, each other phenomena’s saturation is lowered to highlight the phenomena of interest. The graphic then provides a news headline that relates to the topic as well as a blurb on the right-hand corner. The graphic explains the contradiction in the violent video game argument as well as an interesting observation. That this media fear peaks twice a year, in April and November, and I can’t figure out why. So, if anyone knows please let me know. I can’t think of any event or game release or holiday that co-insides with April and November since those things seem consistent over the entire year.
        </p>
        <div class="PhotoHolder">
        <img class="BlogImage" src="../../WebsiteReasources/MOoM Game.png" alt="Just the violent video game statistics of the graph">
        </div>  
        <p>
            This graphic is using a standard X/Y graph to represent the intensity(Y) of media coverage of a phenomena over a 18 year period (X). The default display separates the baseline of these phenomena but since the Y axis is not a set value but is more an indication, I don’t see this as a miss representation but rather a way to show the contrast between phenomenon. The graphic uses colours and a key at the bottom to indicate different phenomena. The three different graph settings “align to baseline”, “scale to fit Ebola”, and “Scale by Deaths” all provide new perspectives to see the relationship between each phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
            The graphic aims to communicate the scale that some phenomena are represented by the mainstream media. While the graphic could be in far greater detail, month by month breakdowns or show a clearer breakdown of what “intensity’ means, I think it still does a good job in showing the difference between phenomena. Rather than what this graph means for an individual phenomenon.
