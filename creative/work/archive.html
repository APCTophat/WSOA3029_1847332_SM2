        <p class="VisTextB">I was introduced to this poem through the grape vine that is the internet. I did not look
            for it, but it found me through pure chance and its minor ripple in my mind has led to this wave in my life.
            I did not know such few words could change my perception of how I live my life. Providing a glimpse behind
            the curtains into the cogs of my own head. So, I am glad it found me and I am glad I can through it back out
            to see who else it finds. Now that I have drastically overhyped the poem you can find it here:

                    made it through worse before”</i></a>
        </p>

        <P>
            <i>all I hear is the wind slapping against the gravestones
                of those who did not make it, those who did not

            <i>did not live to watch the parade roll down the street.

        <p>
            <i>convey that everything ends up fine in the end. There is no

                Sometimes it bends in ways we don’t expect & there are
                people who fall off in the process. Please, dear reader,
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>do not say I am hopeless, I believe there is a better future
                to fight for, I simply accept the possibility that I may not
                live to see it. I have grown weary of telling myself lies</i>

        <p>
            <i>that I might one day begin to believe. We are not all left
            standing after the war has ended. Some of us have
            become ghosts by the time the dust has settled.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Something I do want to clarify about myself quick. The poem may be sad and morbid, but I am not. I am currently doing well, happy, and healthy but inspiration may come from anywhere. Obviously, this year and been…interesting, and I decided to focus on the more down and depressing elements of a global pandemic. I do believe there is hope, I do believe there is good news but my focus for my graphs is on not forgetting that there are real people behind numbers. As of the 20th of November 2020, that number is still on the rise but maybe the global body of knowledge that is the human race can pull through. Here is to Hope and Remembrance.
