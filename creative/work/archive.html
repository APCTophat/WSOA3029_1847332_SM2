        <p class="VisTextB">I was introduced to this poem through the grape vine that is the internet. I did not look
            for it, but it found me through pure chance and its minor ripple in my mind has led to this wave in my life.
            I did not know such few words could change my perception of how I live my life. Providing a glimpse behind
            the curtains into the cogs of my own head. So, I am glad it found me and I am glad I can through it back out
            to see who else it finds. Now that I have drastically overhyped the poem you can find it here:

            <i>all I hear is the wind slapping against the gravestones
