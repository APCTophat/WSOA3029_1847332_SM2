        <p>I was introduced to this poem through the grape vine that is the internet. I did not look for it, but it found me through pure chance and its minor ripple in my mind has led to this wave in my life. Sometimes I did not know such few can change my perception of how I live my life. Providing a glimpse behind the curtains into the cogs of my own head. So, I am glad it found me and I am glad I can through it back out to see who else it finds. Now that I have drastically overhyped the poem you can find it here:

            Especially the first line “all I hear is the wind slapping against the gravestones of those who did not make it,” opened my eyes to how I perceive, tragedy and suffering. I remember repeatedly saying to friends and family things like, “Don’t worry we will make it through this pandemic” or “We only have to not see each other for a couple months, then we can throw a big party”. And the truth is, if everyone said this, they would be lying.

            Currently the total global death toll is 875 thousand (see if you can set this up to work with the API). Sure, comparing that to 17.7Million people that have recovered it ‘doesn’t seem so bad’ but that’s bullshit. That is 875 thousand people whose lives were stolen, just because ‘they’ are people who are far away or people you can’t even perceive. Does not mean it isn’t tragic or treated as a simple statistic. The world lost 875 thousand mothers, fathers, sons, daughter, lovers, best friends and loved ones. The wind is slapping 875 thousand new gravestones, never forget that.
