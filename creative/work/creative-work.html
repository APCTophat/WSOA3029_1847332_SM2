        <p>I was introduced to this poem through the grape vine that is the internet. I did not look for it, but it found me through pure chance and its minor ripple in my mind has led to this wave in my life. I did not know such few words could change my perception of how I live my life. Providing a glimpse behind the curtains into the cogs of my own head. So, I am glad it found me and I am glad I can through it back out to see who else it finds. Now that I have drastically overhyped the poem you can find it here:

            <a href="https://readwildness.com/19/smith-people" target="blank">Clint Smith – <i>When people say, “We have made it through worse before”</i></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Especially the first line “all I hear is the wind slapping against the gravestones of those who did not make it,” opened my eyes to how I perceive, tragedy and suffering. I remember repeatedly saying to friends and family things like, “Don’t worry we will make it through this pandemic” or “We only have to not see each other for a couple months, then we can throw a big party”. And the truth is, if everyone said this, some would be lying.

            Currently the total global death toll is <a class="ChangingTextDeaths"></a>. Sure, comparing that to <a class="ChangingTextRecovered"></a> people that have recovered it ‘doesn’t seem so bad’ but that’s bullshit. That is <a class="ChangingTextDeaths"></a> people whose lives were stolen, just because ‘they’ are people who are far away or people you can’t even perceive. Does not mean it isn’t tragic or treated as a simple statistic. The world lost <a class="ChangingTextDeaths"></a> mothers, fathers, sons, daughter, lovers, best friends and loved ones. The wind is slapping <a class="ChangingTextDeaths"></a> new gravestones, never forget that.
